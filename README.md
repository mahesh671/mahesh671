## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer focused on **Generative AI** and **autonomous agent systems**.

My work revolves around designing and building AI that can:
- reason over context  
- make decisions  
- use tools  
- and act autonomously to solve real problems  

I care deeply about **practical AI** — systems that are reliable, explainable, and actually useful beyond demos.

## 🤖 What I Build

- Autonomous AI agents
- LLM-powered applications
- Tool-using and multi-step reasoning agents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- AI workflows with memory, planning, and execution layers

## 📌 Current Focus

- 🧠 Designing **autonomous AI agents** that can plan, reason, and act
- 🔍 Improving **agent reliability and evaluation**
- ⚙️ Building **scalable Gen-AI backends**
- 🧪 Reducing hallucinations and improving grounding in AI systems

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

> AI should **think less like a chatbot** and **more like a system**.

I believe the future of AI lies in:
- autonomy over prompts  
- systems over single responses  
- reasoning over randomness
